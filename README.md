# TCP Low-Rate-DDoS on 5GmmWave Network - NS3
Network Simulation Project with NS-3. This project is about to simulate TCP Low-Rate-DDoS on 5GmmWave Network.


# Topology
The topology used to simulate this attack contains 4 nodes as follows:\
n0 -> arini (UE legitimate User)\
n1 -> endro (4 UE attackers)\
n2 -> enb (base station connected to yuri)\
n3 -> bob (receiver)
